My daughter is a beautiful gift, that brings warmth to my heart, and brightness to each day. A daughter may outgrow your lap, 
but she will never outgrow your heart. Mothers and daughters are closest, when daughters become mothers. Daughters are a blessing, especially mine.

The fact that, some cultures have been harsh to daughters makes it important to celebrate the little princesses in the world.
Daughters Day is a special day set out to celebrate girls for being equal opportunity human beings.
The stigma that some cultures have placed around the girl child has not only demoralized girls but also taken away their dignity as human beings. 
Therefore, this special day, the Daughters Day is meant to erase the bad memories and stigmas, 
which are attached to having a baby girl instead of a boy.
I love my baby Vamika :)
